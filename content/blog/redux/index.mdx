## My Mental Model Series

_This article is part of the My Mental Model series which seeks to capture my understanding of the programming concepts that I use on a regular basis in a comprehensive way. The goal is for readers to have all of the info that they need in order to reach and to surpass my own understanding of each concept._

## Introduction

[Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) is popular JavaScript library which is commonly paired together with UI frameworks (like Angular or React) in order to develop complex applications that are scalable and easy to maintain. In this installment of "My Mental Model" I'll introduce the core concepts of Redux and then we'll build a minimal app with plain HTML/CSS/JS in order to illustrate those concepts in isolation before exploring integrations with UI frameworks (which we'll do in another post).

## Redux

Redux is a _state management_ library which means that it deals with the _data behind your UI_ rather than dealing with your UI itself. In fact, **Redux is entirely unopionated about your UI** meaning that it can be used alongside _any_ UI framework (React, Angular, Vue, or even plain old HTML/CSS/JS)! This is sometimes surprising to folks who have only seen Redux used alongside React, but we'll see in this post how Redux can work with any type of app at all.

Redux's super power is that it makes sure that every state-change in your application is predictable and traceable.

> If your app's state is starting to get unwieldy and you're having trouble figuring out \*how\* your app got into a given state, Redux may be able to help!

It is comprised of 4 basic components:

1. A **store** where your application's state is kept
2. **Actions** which are simple JavaScript objects that represent state-changing events in your app. Actions say to the store, "hey, _something happened_ and you might need to update the current state!"
3. A **dispatcher** which is used to submit those actions to the store
4. And a **reducer** which is a function used by the store to determine _how_ your application's state should change in response to a given action

The terminology may be unfamiliar, but conceptually it's really pretty simple! We have a single place to keep our state (the store), we have a way to indicate to the store that _something happened_ (actions), and we have a way to interpret those actions in order to decide if/how the state should change (the reducer).

If you've used Redux with React before, you may be surprised that we haven't mentioned anything about `connect`, `<Provider>`, `mapStateToProps` etc. That's because those are concepts from the `react-redux` library which provides helpers to integrate Redux with a React app. Redux works perfectly well without these helpers--in fact--we're about to build a simple application with Redux and we're not going to use React at all!

## A Minimal Redux App

We're going to build a "counter" application. It'll have 2 buttons (plus and minus) and, between the buttons, it will display the current value of the counter. As you've undoubtedly guessed, the value of the counter will change when the user clicks on the plus and minus buttons. It'll look something like this:

<Counter />

### Disclaimer

> Remember: if you're having trouble figuring out \*how\* your app got into a certain state, Redux can help by making sure that state-changes are predictable and traceable

The _state_ that this app tracks is just a single number (the current count), and there are only two ways that the state can change (the plus button and the minus button). **We don't need Redux** in this app! We're going to use it anyway for illustrative purposes, but remember that adding a dependency or framework to your application almost always comes with a cost. In the case of Redux, we introduce some abstractions (e.g. actions, a store, a reducer) which are helpful in complex applications, but add unnecessary cognitive load in simpler projects like this one.

With that said, let's get started!

### The HTML

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Redux Counter</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button id="subtractButton">-</button>
    <div id="counterDisplay">0</div>
    <button id="addButton">+</button>

    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/redux/4.0.0/redux.js"></script>
    <script>
      // here is where we'll use Redux to manage our state
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

There it is. It's beautiful. It's 2 buttons and a div. We've included Redux via a script tag, but we haven't done anything with it yet. Let's change that! 

Redux is going to help us manage the _state_ of our app. But what _is_ an app's _state_?

Earlier, I referred to the state of the app as _the data behind the UI_. In modern UI development, it is often convenient to think of your UI as _a function of your state_, which is to say: given some data (the current state), we should be able to produce a UI for that state. This is a really powerful concept that we won't get too deep into in this post, but suffice to say: we want to be able to determine what our UI looks like based purely on some set of data (the state).

In order to produce our UI, we really only need to know one thing: the current value of the counter. So, let's keep our state in an object like this:

```js
{ count: number }
```

More complex applications would have much more complicated state-layouts, but this one is perfect for our little counter.

Now that we know what our state is going to look like, let's think about the different ways that it can change: the **actions**!

### Thinking about Actions

Before we get into the technical details of how we'll create our actions, let's think about the different ways that our state can change. Well, we've got a plus button and a minus button, so our count can go up by 1 or down by 1. And that's it! We've got 2 actions, let's call them `ADD_ACTION` and `SUBTRACT_ACTION`.

Next, we need to decide how we want to represent those actions in our app. The important thing to remember when choosing how to represent an action is:

> As long as you can accurately determine the next state of the app based on the current state and the action that you send, the action is perfectly valid.

So, we could say:

```html
<script>
  const ADD_ACTION = 'ADD'
  const SUBTRACT_ACTION = 'SUBTRACT'
</script>
```

Given the currentState--let's say `{ count: 0 }`--and one of these actions--let's say `ADD_ACTION`--we can definitely determine the next state of the app: `{ count: 1 }`.

It's really as simple as that! But, what if sometime down the line we wanted to add another button to our app that added 10 to our counter rather than just adding 1? We could create another action `ADD_10_ACTION = 'ADD_10'` and that would work, but we can do better. What if we represented our actions as objects rather than strings like `"ADD"` and `"ADD_10"`? We could, for instance, include the amount that we'd like to add with our action:

```js
ADD_N_ACTION: { type: 'ADD', amount: number }
SUBTRACT_N_ACTION: { type: 'SUBTRACT', amount: number }
```

Then we could write a little factory that could build us an ADD_N_ACTION with whatever value we want. That would make our lives easier when we need to add +5 and +100 buttons to our app.

```html
<script>
  function createAddAction(amount) {
    return { type: 'ADD', amount: amount };
  }
  
  function createSubtractAction(amount) {
    return { type: 'SUBTRACT', amount: amount };
  }
</script>
```

This pattern of creating functions which produce actions is called the `actionCreator` pattern, and it's used in almost every Redux app that I've ever seen!

Even though we don't need the `actionCreator` pattern for this app, let's use it anyway so that we're ready to adapt to future feature requirements.

Next, let's build the reducer function!

### Reducer

In the Redux world, the reducer function has a very important job: take the current state of the app plus an action and return the next state of the app.

> The reducer: `currentState` + `action` = `nextState`

Our reducer needs to be able to handle two different types actions: "ADD"s and "SUBTRACT"s. When an "ADD" is received, we'll increment the counter by whatever `amount` is attached to the action, and when "SUBTRACT" is received we'll decrement the counter by whatever `amount` is attached to the action.

```html
<script>
  // action creators omitted for brevity

  const initialState = { count: 0 }

  function reduce(currentState = initialState, action) {
    // remember, our action looks like this:
    // { type: "ADD" | "SUBTRACT", amount: number }
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'ADD':
        return {
          ...currentState,
          count: currentState.count + action.amount,
        }
      case 'SUBTRACT':
        return {
          ...currentState,
          count: currentState.count - action.amount,
        }
      default:
        /*
        if the action.type was not ADD or SUBTRACT,
        we return the currentState unchanged
        */
        return currentState
    }
  }
</script>
```

Again, we're following some conventions here, but it's worth pointing out that _we don't need to_. The reducer is simply a function. There's no magic (tm). The switch statement is a convenient and scalable way to process different types of actions, but you could use a regular if/else if you wanted to!

#### A note on equality

In order for Redux to determine whether or not your state has actually changed after an action has been dispatched, the store does something like this:

```js
// Redux store pseudocode

function onActionReceived(action) {
  const nextState = reducer(currentState, action)

  if (nextState !== currentState) {
    currentState = nextState
    broadcast('State changed!')
  }
}
```

The store will only broadcast that the state changed if `nextState !== currentState`.

This is not the exact implementation of the comparison, but it's good enough for our mental model. Keep in mind that `nextState` and `currentState` might be huge, complex objects which represent the entire state of a highly-interactive app. Redux doesn't have the time to traverse the entire `currentState` and `nextState` objects in order to determine if _every single key_ and _every single value_ is exactly the same between both of them. Instead, it uses a _referential comparison_ (e.g. `nextState !== currentState`) to see if the two values _refer_ to the same spot in memory.

This type of comparison is **super fast**, but there is a big "gotcha" that we need to keep in mind. Have a look at this example of a broken reducer:

```js
// this reducer is broken!

function reduce(currentState, action) {
  if (action.type === 'ADD') {
    currentState.count += action.amount
  } else if (action.type === 'SUBTRACT') {
    currentState.count -= action.amount
  }

  return currentState
}
```

Even though we updated `count`, the object that we returned from the reducer _is the same exact object that was passed **in** to the reducer_ (`currentState`). So, when the store compares the new state with the old state, it'll say "they're both the same object; no state change detected!"

This is a **huge** deal! If we aren't careful with how we build our reducer, Redux will fail to detect state changes.

> It's why we always return a new top-level object from our reducer when the state changes

Let's have a look back at our first reducer and focus on the _return values_.

```js
switch (action.type) {
  case 'ADD':
    // returns a new object
    return {
      ...currentState, // clone the currentState's children
      count: currentState.count + action.amount, // overwrite count
    }
  case 'SUBTRACT':
    // returns a new object
    return {
      ...currentState, // clone the currentState's children
      count: currentState.count - action.amount, // overwrite count
    }
  default:
    return currentState // return the currentState as-is, there's no change
}
```

This reducer always returns new state-objects when the state has changed, and returns the old state-object when the state hasn't changed. It uses the spread operator (`...`) to create a shallow clone of the old state-object and overwrites the part of state that needs to be updated. The spread operator's shallow-clone functionality is sufficient for what we need to do. It's okay that we didn't recursively clone every nested object within our state because **as long as the top-level object returned from the reducer is a new object, Redux will know that something changed.**

### Store

Now that we have our reducer, we'll construct our store. We'll use Redux's `createStore` method and we'll pass it the `reduce` function that we created in the last step. Note that this is the first time we've actually used the Redux library at all; everything else that we've done has just been plain old objects and functions!

```html
<script>
  // ... actions and reducer omitted for brevity

  const store = Redux.createStore(reduce)
</script>
```

Awesome! At this point we've got a fancy new Redux store complete with a reducer that can handle `ADD`s and `SUBTRACT`s. The next step is to be able to dispatch those actions to the store whenever the user clicks one of our buttons.

### Dispatch

```html
<script>
  // ... actions and reducer omitted for brevity

  const store = Redux.createStore(reduce)

  document.getElementById('addButton').onclick = () => {
    // we'll create an ADD_1 action using our actionCreator
    // createAddAction(1) returns { type: "ADD", amount: 1 }
    const ADD_1_ACTION = createAddAction(1) 
  
    // then dispatch it to the store
    store.dispatch(ADD_1_ACTION)
  }

  document.getElementById('subtractButton').onclick = () => {
    const SUBTRACT_1_ACTION = createSubtractAction(1)
    store.dispatch(SUBTRACT_1_ACTION)
  }
</script>
```

We're using the `dispatch` method that's exposed by the store in order to indicate that an action has occurred. Behind the scenes, the store will invoke our reducer function and determine the next state of the application, then it will broadcast a message out to any subscribers to let them know that the state has changed.

Let's take a moment to recap what we've done so far.
- We defined the shape of the _state_ of our app: it looked like this `{ count: number }`
- We defined 2 _action-creators_, which create actions for us. The actions themselves were just simple objects like this `{ type: "ADD", amount: 1 }`
- We defined our _reducer_, which is a function that handles the operation: `currentState + action = nextState`
- We used `Redux` to create a `store` and told that store that it should use our reducer function to figure out _how_ to change our app's state
- We defined click-handlers for our buttons which use the store's `dispatch` function to send `ADD_ACTION`s and `SUBTRACT_ACTION`s to the store; then we used plain old JavaScript `getElementById` to attach those handlers to our UI elements

Now, when we click those buttons, data is flowing through our app!

1) We click a button
2) That dispatches an action to the store
3) The store uses the `reducer` to determine the next state
4) The store broadcasts that the state changed

All that's left to do is to subscribe to those changes and to update our on-screen counter!

### Subscribing to changes

We'll use the `subscribe` function that's exposed by the `store` in order to listen for any changes to our app's state.

```html
<script>
  // ... actions, reducer, store-creation, and action-dispatching omitted for brevity

  store.subscribe(() => {
    // get the state
    const stateSnapshot = store.getState()

    console.log('state changed', stateSnapshot)
  
    // use plain old JavaScript to update our UI
    document.getElementById('counterDisplay').innerText = stateSnapshot.counter
  })
</script>
```

And we're done! [Here's a link to the full code](https://gist.github.com/tripphamm/f340d92dec153f4ca5f2a31a58be9ce4).

## Wrap Up

We've just written a minimal, but fully-functional Redux application. We've seen how "actions" are just simple objects, the reducer is just a plain function, and that the Redux-specific code really just boils down to:

1. `createStore` - to create the store
2. `store.dispatch` - to dispatch an action
3. `store.subscribe` - to listen for updates to the state

Now that we've covered the core functionality of Redux, we can look at [how it integrates with a framework like React](/react-redux).
