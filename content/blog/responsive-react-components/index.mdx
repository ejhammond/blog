## Responsive Web Design

In today's world, we know that folks are just as likely to visit our web page on their phone as they are to visit our web page on a laptop/desktop computer. So, in order to make sure that folks get a great experience no matter how they choose to interact with our content, we need to be thinking about how our page _responds_ to different screen-size requirements. A page is considered to be _responsive_ when it is able to gracefully change its content in order to fit any potential screen size. Note that this is not the strict definition of a responsive web design, but it's sufficient for this article.

Most responsive pages make use of [grid systems](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Legacy_Layout_Methods) which are wonderful abstractions that allow us to resize and to re-position our content based on the size of a user's screen. In many cases, a grid system is all you really need in order to build a great responsive experience, but sometimes you need more control over exactly how your components look/behave across different screen sizes.

In this article, we're gonna talk about how we can go beyond size and positioning in order to make our components fully responsive!

## Fully Responsive Components

> For the rest of this post, we're going to be using React components to illustrate concepts, but these ideas can be applied to any component-based UI framework (Angular/Vue/Svelte etc.)!

### A Carousel Case Study

Let's say that we're building a responsive web page and we need to show a [carousel](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/designing-effective-carousels/) of images.

On large screens we want to show 4 images at a time, but on very small screens we can't fit 4 images without making them tiny, so we only want to show 1 image.

> Quick note here: when I say "screen size" I really mean "window/screen size". In windowed environements (like desktop/laptop browsers), we're concerned with the size of the window rather than the size of the screen itself. I just don't want to write window/screen every time.

Here's a mockup of what we want. 4 images on large screens like a full-screen desktop browser, 2 images on medium screens like a tablet, and 1 image on small screens like a mobile phone. While we're at it, let's drop the arrows on the phone-sized screen too.

<Figure
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'space-evenly',
  }}
  xs={{
    style: {
      flexDirection: 'column',
    },
  }}
>
  <CappedWidthBox maxWidth={300}>
    <FixedAspectRatioBox aspectRatio={566 / 976}>
      <img
        alt="Carousel on a desktop-sized screen"
        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ejhammond/image/upload/v1578886772/tripps-tips/responsive-react-components/carousel-desktop.png"
      />
    </FixedAspectRatioBox>
  </CappedWidthBox>
  <CappedWidthBox maxWidth={131}>
    <FixedAspectRatioBox aspectRatio={730 / 548}>
      <img
        alt="Carousel on a tablet-sized screen"
        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ejhammond/image/upload/v1578887141/tripps-tips/responsive-react-components/carousel-tablet.png"
      />
    </FixedAspectRatioBox>
  </CappedWidthBox>
  <CappedWidthBox maxWidth={94}>
    <FixedAspectRatioBox aspectRatio={367 / 193}>
      <img
        alt="Carousel on a phone-sized screen"
        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ejhammond/image/upload/v1578887181/tripps-tips/responsive-react-components/carousel-phone-no-arrows.png"
      />
    </FixedAspectRatioBox>
  </CappedWidthBox>
</Figure>

And here's the API for the `Carousel` component.

```jsx
<Carousel
  // needs to be 4, 2, or 1 depending on screen size
  imagesToShow={someNumber}
  // needs to be false on phone-sized screens
  showArrows={trueOrFalse}
/>
```

How can we make that work?

#### Breakpoints

Well, the first step is to decide exactly what we mean by "large", "medium", and "small". We need to decide the exact screen-widths where we switch from one to the next. Commonly, these specific widths are called _breakpoints_ and the ranges themselves ("large", "medium", "small") are called _screen classes_.

#### Media Queries

Once we have our breakpoints defined, we can use [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries) in order to ask the browser to tell us the device's current screen class. Due to the popularity of media queries in CSS, many folks have the perception that media queries are a feature of CSS, but (and this is a bit of a spoiler about where this article is headed) you can actually use media queries in your JavaScript code as well!

#### Using Media Queries with CSS

Now that we have a way to ask our browser about the current size of the user's screen, let's put it to use!

Let's start with using the media-query solution that I see most often. That technique involves using media queries in CSS in order to alter the styles of a component based on the size of the screen.

This works great for shrinking the font size of your headings on small devices, or making a button bigger on touch screens, but the tricky part here is that the `imagesToShow` property is not controlled by a CSS style, so we can't write a CSS rule to override the value depending on the screen size.

The next step that folks often take is use media queries to create CSS rules that allow them to show/hide content based on the size of a screen. With these rules, we can say "show this 4-slide carousel on large screens, but not medium or small screens" etc.

Let's play that out.

```jsx
<Carousel
  imagesToShow={4}
  className="hidden-on-medium-screens hidden-on-small-screens"
/>
<Carousel
  imagesToShow={2}
  className="hidden-on-large-screens hidden-on-small-screens"
/>
<Carousel
  imagesToShow={1}
  showArrows={false}
  className="hidden-on-large-screens hidden-on-medium-screens"
/>
```

This will work! But there are a few drawbacks. The first one is that we're actually shipping a lot of extra code (bytes) to our users; rather than a single `Carousel`, we're sending 3 `Carousel`s each with different props. That's more to download and parse for the browser and it'll negatively impact our page's performance. The second issue is that this pattern is going to be really hard to maintain; having duplicate (or triplicate) components all over your codebase is gonna make your code hard to read and error-prone.

So, is there a way to avoid shipping all of that duplicate code? Well, if we knew the size of the user's screen _ahead of time_, we could just choose the right value and send it to them. This pattern is called _adaptive_ (vs _responsive_) and a lot of folks use it. The drawback here is that detecting the user's screen size ahead of time (e.g. by examining the request from the browser before you send the page response) is tougher than it sounds, and the pattern doesn't work very well when users resize their windows (or rotate their device).

Let's try something else.

#### Using Media Queries in JavaScript

As I mentioned earlier, we can actually utilize media queries in JavaScript and not just in CSS. Specifically, we can make use the browser's [`matchMedia`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) function in order to check the size of the user's screen.

Here's an example where we use `matchMedia` to check if the screen is "large" or not. We use the `addListener` function in order to be notified if the media query result ever changes. The listener will be fired when we go from not-matching to matching and it will also be fired when we go from matching back to not-matching.

```js
let currentScreenClass = undefined

const largeScreenMediaQuery = '(min-width: 1200px)'

const mediaQueryList = window.matchMedia(largeScreenMediaQuery)

mediaQueryList.addListener(event => {
  if (event.matches) {
    currentScreenClass = 'LARGE'
  } else {
    currentScreenClass = 'NOT LARGE'
  }
})
```

If we're using React, we could create a [Context Provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) at the root of our app that would use code like this in order to keep track of the current screen class. Then our components could consume that context in order to decide what to do.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  // theoretical `useScreenClassContext`
  // that gets the current screen class
  // from a Context Provider
  // where Context Provider is using
  // window.matchMedia
  const { screenClass } = useScreenClassContext()

  let imagesToShow
  switch (screenClass) {
    case 'large':
      imagesToShow = 4
      break
    case 'medium':
      imagesToShow = 2
      break
    case 'small':
      imagesToShow = 1
      break
  }

  return <Carousel imagesToShow={imagesToShow} />
}
```

And now our `Carousel` is _fully responsive_! Now that we have the current screen class available in our JavaScript code, we can make any property change its value based on the size of the users screen.

### React Responsive System

I've been using this pattern (media queries + React Context) for a while in order to create responsive React components and I like it so much that I've built a library to make it easier to pull off. It's called [`react-responsive-system`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-system).

Responsive System creates media queries based on your breakpoints and then gives you a React Context Provider that you can render in your app.

Rather than writing a `switch` statement in your component, you just specify your overrides as props like this:

```jsx
// just pass your component to the `responsive` util...
// all of your screen classes are added as props
// and the overrides will be handled automatically
const ResponsiveCarousel = responsive(Carousel)

<ResponsiveCarousel
  imagesToShow={4} // default to 4 images
  medium={{ imagesToShow: 2 }} // override props on `medium` screens
  small={{ imagesToShow: 1, showArrows: false }} // override on `small` screens
/>
```

The cool part is: you don't need to modify the component's code at all! The `medium` and `small` props in this example are added automatically just by using the `responsive` utility. Furthermore, they're based on your own custom names for your breakpoints, so if your breakpoints are called "phone", "tablet", and "desktop" your components will get props with those names instead!
